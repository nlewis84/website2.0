# website2.0
Version 2.0 of my website

I have just recently started learning code. I started with HTML and CSS on October 9th, 15 days ago. 

This version of my website is very "bare bones" and I have just started looking at Bootstrap. This website utilizes everything that's I've learned so far over 2 weeks.
